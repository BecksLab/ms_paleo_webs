"""
    diameter(A::AbstractMatrix{<:Bool})

Calculates the diameter of a food web represented by an adjacency matrix A.
It explicitly builds the graph using the edge list (A[i, j] = 1 means i -> j)
to ensure correct construction, then uses the Floyd-Warshall algorithm from Graphs.jl.
The diameter is filtered using the V-1 rule to exclude unreachable paths.
