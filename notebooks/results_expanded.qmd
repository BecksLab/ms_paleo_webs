# Effects of Network Reconstruction on Food-Web Structure

## Table S1. Descriptive statistics of network metrics by model

```{r}
library(knitr)
library(tidyverse)

readr::read_csv("tables/Table_S1_descriptive_stats.csv") %>%
kable()

```

## Table S2. Univariate ANOVA results with partial η² and 95% CI

```{r}

readr::read_csv("tables/Table_S2_ANOVA_eta.csv") %>%
kable()

```

## Table S3. Tukey-adjusted pairwise comparisons (estimated marginal means)

```{r}

readr::read_csv("tables/Table_S3_Tukey_pairs.csv") %>%
kable()

```

## Table S4. LDA coefficients for each variable and linear discriminant axis

```{r}

readr::read_csv("tables/Table_S5_LDA_coeffs.csv") %>%
kable()

```

## Table S5. Correlation of original variables with LD axes

```{r}

readr::read_csv("tables/Table_S6_LD_correlations.csv") %>%
kable()

```

# Model choice influences inferred extinction dynamics

## Figure S3. Raw temporal trajectories of network structure during extinction simulations.

Panels show mean values of network-level metrics through time for each reconstruction model, grouped by macro-, meso-, and micro-scale properties as in Figure 3. Lines represent raw simulation outputs averaged across replicates. This figure provides the underlying data corresponding to the GAM-predicted trajectories shown in Figure 3.

## Table S6. Full generalized additive model (GAM) results for network-level metrics.

Parametric coefficients, model-specific smooth terms, and ANOVA comparisons of shared versus model-specific time effects are shown for each network metric. Estimate/EDF and Std. Error / Ref.df correspond to parametric coefficients or effective degrees of freedom and reference degrees of freedom for smooth terms. t/F value and p-value report statistical significance. Parametric terms represent the baseline effect of each model; smooth terms describe non-linear temporal trajectories of each reconstruction model. ANOVA rows compare the fit of shared versus model-specific smooths. No inference or interpretation is implied in this table; the main text and Figure 3 provide inferential conclusions.

```{r}

readr::read_csv("tables/Table_S7_GAM_results.csv") %>%
kable()

```

## Table S7. ANOVA comparisons of shared versus model-specific GAM smooths for all network-level metrics.

Each row shows the result of comparing a generalized additive model (GAM) with a shared smooth term for time across reconstruction models versus a model-specific smooth term for each reconstruction model. Columns include the F value and p-value of the ANOVA test. Very small p-values are reported as <0.001. These tests indicate whether allowing model-specific temporal trajectories significantly improves model fit; no inferential claims about the direction or magnitude of changes are made in this table.
