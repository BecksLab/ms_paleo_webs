# Different pfim configurations

## Maximal Rules

An extremely subdivided-nuanced set of traits and feeding rules

## Minimal Rules

Lumping some of the different traits in order to have fewer feeding rules. 

##Â Guild/trophic species

Taking away the taxonomic specification and taking a 'functional' approach

# Downstream effects of the different configurations

![TODO.](figures/summary_pfim.png)

Redundancy? Structure? Basal node?

# Downsampling
