abstract: |
  Food webs provide a powerful lens for understanding ecosystem structure and function, but reconstructing them in paleoecological contexts remains challenging because direct evidence of feeding interactions is rarely preserved. A wide range of models now exist for predicting interactions and inferring network structure, yet these models vary widely in their assumptions, mechanisms, and data requirements. Here, we evaluate which network construction approaches are most suitable for paleo-food-web reconstruction given the constraints of the fossil record, and we assess how model choice shapes the networks we infer. Using the Toarcian Oceanic Anoxic Event (Early Jurassic, ~183 Ma) as a case study, we compare six modelling approaches encompassing mechanistic, structural, and theory-based methods. These models yield strikingly different network structures and pairwise interactions, and that these discrepancies propagate into ecological inference, including conclusions about extinction dynamics. This study bridges paleoecology and modern network theory by demonstrating that food-web reconstruction models are not interchangeable representations of the same past ecosystem, but distinct ecological hypotheses with measurable consequences. Highlighting the need to align model choice with research questions and underscore the interpretative risks of treating all food-web reconstruction methods as interchangeable.

# Introduction

There is growing interest in using deep-time fossil data and evidence of species interactions in past ecosystems (e.g., @dunne2008; @dunne2014) as a foundation for understanding how ecological communities respond to multi-stressor environmental change, such as temperature increase, ocean acidification, and hypoxia [@kiessling2019; @dillon2022]. Paleoecological networks therefore represent a particularly valuable opportunity to investigate community responses to major environmental transitions as they allow for the explicit construction of pre- and post-extinction interaction networks and enable the disentangling of extinction drivers as well as broader cascading effects [@dunhill2024; @yeakel2014; @roopnarine2006]. Insights gained from these deep-time systems provide a critical context for interpreting present day ecological change and anticipating the impacts of ongoing anthropogenic stressors [@roopnarine2018; @barnosky2012].

Inference from ecological networks regarding structure and complexity is (at its core) a mathematical task and is therefore relatively independent of biological assumptions [@delmas2019]. While these structural properties can be analysed independently of biological detail, their implications for stability and dynamics depend critically on assumptions about interaction strengths, and distributions [@allesina2012]. Thus, assumptions become meaningful once network structure and complexity are interpreted in functional terms or used as templates for simulating community and extinction dynamics. While there is a well-developed theoretical framework describing what can be inferred from network properties, a central challenge (particularly in paleoecology) lies in how networks are constructed. Unlike modern systems, paleoecological interactions are rarely directly observed, with only exceptional cases preserving explicit evidence of trophic interactions (*e.g.,* @jenny2019; @vullo2011). As a result, paleo food web reconstruction depends on indirect inference, drawing on preserved traits, analogies with modern taxa, and ecological theory. Simply put, network reconstruction is not a data recovery process, but rather hypothesis generation under constraints.

Although numerous tools exist for inferring species interactions [see @morales-castilla2015; @pichler2023; @strydom2021; @allesina2008 for reviews], only a subset can be reliably applied in paleo contexts, where data on traits, abundances, and community composition are incomplete and systematically biased. This makes it essential to clearly articulate which reconstruction approaches are appropriate for which inferential purposes. Recent work has shown that reconstruction approaches (*e.g.,* models based on traits, abundances, or co-occurrence) can be categorised by the type of network that they predict [@strydom2026]. These include feasible networks (derived from trait matching and phylogenetic inference that produce metawebs of plausible interactions), realised networks, (constrained by ecological rules and evidence of actual feeding relationships), and purely structural networks (which reproduce ecologically plausible topologies but lack species-level node identities). These different network representation represent analytical constructs, not strict biological realities *per se*.

Each of these reconstruction approaches carries distinct assumptions that influence inferred network size, complexity, structure, and node-level properties, with direct consequences for ecological interpretations of extinction dynamics, stability, resilience, and ecosystem function [@solé2001; @dunne2002; @roopnarine2006]. Despite this, most paleo food web studies default to constructing networks using expert knowledge (*e.g.,* @dunne2008) or mechanistic feeding rules (*e.g.,* @dunhill2024; @roopnarine2017; @fricke2022), approaches that typically result in metawebs. This raises a critical but underexplored question: to what extent does the choice of network type (and particularly the use of alternatives to metawebs) control not only inferred food web structure but also conclusions about system behaviour, especially with respect to extinction cascades and vulnerability.

In this study, we address this question by linking recent advances in network reconstruction methods to a comparative re-evaluation of primary and secondary, trait-based extinction dynamics during the early Toarcian extinction event, a volcanic-driven hyperthermal and marine extinction event in the Early Jurassic (\~183Ma) [@dunhill2024]. We reconstruct four communities—pre-extinction, post-extinction, early recovery, and late recovery, from the Cleveland Basin of North Yorkshire, UK, using six different network reconstruction methods. For each community, we compare network- and node-level characteristics predicted by each method, allowing us to assess how reconstruction assumptions and ecological characterisations shape inferred community structure and interaction patterns. Finally, we replicate the secondary extinction analyses of Dunhill et al. for the pre to post-extinction transition across all six reconstruction methods to explicitly show how methodological assumptions and the resulting network structures influence the inference about the drivers and ecological targets of extinction events.

# Materials and Methods

## Study system and fossil data

We used fossil occurrence data from the Cleveland Basin spanning the upper Pliensbachian to the upper Toarcian, following Dunhill et al. (2024). Four paleo-communities were defined: pre-extinction, post-extinction, early recovery, and late recovery. Each assemblage was treated as a community of potentially interacting taxa. Modes of life were assigned following Dunhill et al. (2024) using the Bambach ecospace framework. Traits included motility, tiering, feeding mode, and size class, with size defined categorically based on maximum linear dimensions.

## Network reconstruction approaches

### Conceptual classification of network types

Most paleo-specific approaches currently operate within the feasibility space [*e.g.,* @shaw2024; @roopnarine2006; @fricke2022]. Although well suited for reconstructing feasible interactions, these methods represent only a subset of the broader spectrum of network construction approaches. Here, we present a suite of models [@tbl-models] that enable the construction of a wider range of ecological networks and the exploration of a broader set of ecological questions, provided that their underlying assumptions are compatible with the constraints of fossil data. For example, some tools require quantitative estimates of body size, which must often be inferred from size classes or functional morphology in the fossil record. Structural models, such as the niche model, rely only on species richness and connectance, but their species-agnostic nature limits their applicability to trait-based or diet-specific questions. Mechanistic approaches, by contrast, depend on accurate assignment of feeding traits or robust phylogenetic support. Recognizing how these methodological requirements intersect with the limits of fossil evidence is essential for selecting an appropriate modelling framework.

| Model family | Assumptions | Data needs | 'Limitation' | Network type | Key reference |
|------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|
| random | Links are randomly distributed within a network | richness, number of links | parameter assumptions, species agnostic | structural network | @erdos1959 |
| niche | Networks are interval, species can be ordered on a 'niche axis' | richness, connectance | parameter assumptions, species agnostic | structural network | @williams2008 |
| allometric diet breadth model (ADBM) | Interactions are determined by energetic costs (foraging ecology) | body mass, biomass (abundance) | does not account for forbidden links in terms of trait compatibility, assumptions on body size and biomass (abundance) from fossil data | realised network | @petchey2008 |
| l-matrix | Interactions inferred using allometric rules (ratio of body sizes between predator and prey), with links being constrained by a Ricker function | body mass, number of producer species | does not account for forbidden links in terms of trait compatibility, assumptions on body size from fossil data, assumptions as to the number of producer species | realised network | @schneider2016 |

: Six different models that can be used to construct food webs for both this specific community but are also broadly suited to paleo network prediction. These models span all facets of the network representation space (metaweb, realised, and structural network) and are suitable for an array of different paleo communities as the data requirements fall within the limitations set by the fossil record. {#tbl-models}

### Network generation and replication

We evaluated six models spanning this space [@tbl-models]: random and niche models (structural network); allometric diet breadth (ADBM), l-matrix, and body-size ratio models (realised network); and a paleo food-web inference model (PFIM; feasibility web). For each community, we constructed 100 replicate networks using each of the six models (2 400 networks total). Networks were simplified by removing disconnected species. For size-based models, body masses were drawn from uniform distributions bounded by size-class limits,allowing for variance between replicates but preserving relative sizes within replicates. Structural models were parameterised using connectance values drawn from an empirically realistic ranges (0.07–0.34) while holding richness constant. The same parameter draws were used across comparable models within each replicate.

## Network metrics and structural analyses

We quantified network structure using a suite of macro-, meso-, and micro-scale metrics [@tbl-properties], capturing global properties, motif structure, and species-level variability. Differences among models were assessed using MANOVA, followed by univariate ANOVAs, post-hoc comparisons, and linear discriminant analysis. Pairwise interaction turnover was quantified using link-based beta diversity for models that infer species-specific interactions.

|------------------|-------------------|------------------|------------------|
| Richness | Number of nodes in the network | Macro |  |
| Links | Normalized standard deviation of links (number of consumers plus resources per taxon) | Micro |  |
| Connectance | $L/S^2$, where $S$ is the number of species and $L$ the number of links | Macro |  |
| Max trophic level | Prey-weighted trophic level averaged across taxa | Macro | @williams2004 |
| S1 | Number of linear chains, normalised | Meso | @milo2002; @stouffer2007 |

| Vulnerability | Normalized standard deviation of vulnerability of a species standardized by $L/S$ | Micro | @williams2000 |

## Extinction simulations and model evaluation

Using pre-extinction networks, we simulated species loss under multiple extinction scenarios, including trait-based, network-position-based, and random removals, allowing for secondary extinctions. Simulated networks were compared to empirical post-extinction communities using mean absolute differences (MAD) in network metrics and a modified true skill statistic (TSS) at both node and link levels. Scenario rankings were compared across models using Kendall’s rank correlation coefficient.

# Results

Across six reconstruction approaches, both global network structure and species-level interactions differed substantially, with implications for interpreting past extinction dynamics. Deterministic models (e.g., PFIM) tended to produce more consistent network-level patterns and smoother extinction trajectories, whereas stochastic or theory-driven models (e.g., ADBM, niche, L-matrix) showed greater variability in inferred interactions and temporal dynamics. Models with similar macro-level metrics sometimes differed in pairwise interactions, highlighting that agreement in global structure does not guarantee concordance at the species level. Consequently, inferred extinction pathways and secondary extinctions were highly sensitive to model choice, emphasizing the importance of evaluating multiple network reconstructions when interpreting ecological dynamics in deep time.

## Network structure differs among reconstruction approaches

To test whether network reconstruction approach influences inferred food-web structure, we compared multivariate patterns of network metrics across all six models using a MANOVA. Network structure differed strongly among reconstruction approaches (MANOVA, Pillai’s trace = 3.81, approximate $F_{40,11955}$ = 962.12, p \< 0.001). Univariate analyses showed that model choice explained a large proportion of variance in most network metrics, with high partial η² values for connectance, generality, vulnerability, and motif frequencies (η² = 0.66–0.92). In contrast, maximum trophic level exhibited a much smaller effect of model choice (η² = 0.04). Estimated marginal means and Tukey-adjusted comparisons indicated consistent differences among reconstruction approaches, with PFIM differing significantly from all other models (p ≤ 0.026), while ADBM and L-matrix did not differ from one another (p = 1.00). Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) further distinguished reconstruction approaches in multivariate network space [@fig-structure], with the first two axes explaining 86.5% of between-model variance (LD1 = 53.9%, LD2 = 32.6%). LD1 was most strongly correlated with vulnerability, connectance, and S4 motifs, whereas LD2 was associated primarily with generality, S2, and S5 motifs. Higher-order axes each explained less than 9% of the remaining variance. This demonstrates that reconstruction approach leaves a strong multivariate signature independent of community composition.

### Inferred pairwise interactions vary widely among models

Building on differences in global network structure, we next examined how reconstruction approach influences species-level ecological inference by quantifying turnover in inferred pairwise interactions among networks constructed from the same taxon pool. While models that produced similar global metrics sometimes agreed broadly on network structure, they often differed sharply in the specific interactions they inferred.

Pairwise β-turnover revealed that some model pairs shared very few links despite comparable macro- or meso-scale properties (Fig. S3). **ADBM** and **L-matrix** were highly concordant, reflecting similar underlying assumptions, whereas the **body-size ratio** model consistently exhibited high turnover relative to all other approaches. **PFIM** showed intermediate overlap with size-based theoretical models. These patterns indicate that agreement in global network metrics does not guarantee agreement in species-level diets or trophic roles, highlighting the importance of evaluating both network- and species-level outcomes when comparing reconstruction methods.

## Model choice influences inferred extinction dynamics

To quantify how network structure changed over time during extinction simulations and whether these dynamics differed among reconstruction models, we fit generalized additive models (GAMs) to network-level metrics. GAMs capture nonlinear temporal trajectories, allowing formal tests of whether the shape of these trajectories differs among models. For connectance, the model-specific smooth terms were all significant (e.g., PFIM: EDF = 2.99, F = 113.8, p \< 0.001; ADBM: EDF = 2.92, F = 22.6, p \< 0.001), indicating distinct temporal patterns across reconstruction approaches. Trophic level trajectories also differed among models (PFIM: EDF = 2.96, F = 36.7, p \< 0.001; Niche: EDF = 2.96, F = 94.9, p \< 0.001). Deterministic approaches, such as PFIM, produced more consistent and smooth trajectories, whereas stochastic, theory-driven models (niche, ADBM, lmatrix) displayed greater variability in timing and magnitude of structural change. These results demonstrate that inferred pathways of collapse, trophic bottlenecks, and secondary extinctions are highly sensitive to model choice.

To evaluate how model choice affects inferred extinction dynamics, we compared simulated post-extinction networks to observed networks using mean absolute differences (MAD) for network-level metrics and total sum-of-squares (TSS) for node- and link-level outcomes [@fig-mad]. Overall, models were more consistent in ranking extinction scenarios at the network level: Kendall’s $\tau$ values for MAD-based rankings were generally positive, with strong agreement between ADBM and L-matrix models ($\tau$ ≈ 0.82) and weaker or inconsistent correlations involving stochastic models such as log ratio or random ($\tau$ ranging from −0.26 to 0.44). Node-level TSS scores similarly showed broad consistency across models, reflecting comparable species removal sequences ($\tau$ ≈ 0.38–0.46 between ADBM and niche or PFIM). In contrast, link-level outcomes were more variable: deterministic models like PFIM maintained moderate agreement with observed post-extinction links ($\tau$ ≈ 0.44), whereas stochastic, theory-driven models exhibited low or inconsistent correlations ($\tau$ as low as −0.44). These results indicate that while different models often recover similar species-level extinction patterns, inferred interaction loss and cascade dynamics are highly sensitive to model choice.

Warmer colours approaching zero represent little or no agreement. Panels illustrate how consistently different modelling approaches evaluate the relative realism of extinction scenarios across multiple network properties.](figures/kendal_tau.png){#fig-mad}

# Discussion

# Model choice as a component of ecological inference

Reconstructing food webs from fossil data is inherently an exercise in inference under uncertainty [@dunne2008; @morales-castilla2015]. Our results demonstrate that the choice of network reconstruction model is itself a major ecological decision, shaping not only the structural properties of inferred networks but also downstream interpretations of extinction dynamics [@allesina2012; @solé2001]. Even with identical taxon pools, different models yield networks that diverge in global metrics, species-level interactions, and temporal patterns of collapse. These divergences do not stem from the fossil data themselves but rather reflect assumptions embedded in each reconstruction approach. [@pichler2023; @strydom2021]. Consequently, network reconstruction is not a neutral methodological step; model choice shapes the ecological narratives we extract from ancient ecosystems.

Previous paleoecological network studies have highlighted the importance of model assumptions, particularly when reconstructing metawebs from limited evidence [@roopnarine2006; @dunhill2024]. Our findings extend this work by systematically comparing six network types and showing that these conceptual categories correspond to consistent clusters of network properties. These clusters mirror conceptual distinctions among feasible, realised, and structural network representations [@strydom2026]. Feasible networks (PFIM) capture all trait-compatible interactions, realised networks (ADBM, L-matrix, body-size ratio) encode energetic and foraging constraints, and structural networks (niche, random) reproduce generic topologies without species-specific resolution. Critically, pairwise turnover analyses reveal that models often disagree not only on the number of links but on which species interact, consistent with prior observations that metawebs can overestimate realized interactions [@fricke2022; @shaw2024].

The downstream consequences of model choice are most pronounced when evaluating extinction dynamics [@dunne2002; @sahasrabudhe2011]. While broad, trait-driven patterns of species loss are relatively robust across models, the identity of lost interactions, secondary extinctions, and cascade dynamics are sensitive to the type of network reconstructed. Node-level patterns tend to be more stable because they reflect inherent species traits and extinction susceptibility, whereas link-level outcomes depend on energetic and structural constraints embedded in each model. This distinction mirrors findings in modern food-web studies, where deterministic and stochastic model assumptions influence the magnitude and timing of secondary extinctions [@dunne2002; @yeakel2014; @allesina2012]. Our results suggest that interpretations of trophic collapse, bottlenecks, and recovery trajectories are shaped not only by the fossil record but also by the choice of network model. Consequently, paleoecologists must carefully consider which ecological signals they aim to recover (potential interactions, realized diets, or macro-scale structural properties) before selecting a reconstruction approach. Importantly the disagreement among models does not imply that any single model is 'wrong' or 'better' but rather highlights that 'all models are wrong but some are useful' [@stouffer2019] and it is a case of aligning the research question with the appropriate model.

## Aligning ecological questions with model choice

A central insight from our study is that different ecological questions require different network representations. Feasibility networks are most appropriate for evaluating potential trophic links or dietary breadth; realised networks capture energetically constrained, ecologically plausible interactions; and structural networks are suited for exploring generic topological patterns such as connectance or trophic depth. Link-level dynamics and cascade sensitivity are particularly sensitive to network choice, whereas higher-level patterns of species loss are less so.

This alignment between question and model type reflects a broader trend in network ecology emphasizing the role of assumptions in determining which inferences are valid [@delmas2019; @petchey2008; @schneider2016]. By explicitly matching network representation to research question, paleoecologists can avoid overinterpreting model-dependent artifacts as biological signals.

Below is a conceptual summary:

| **Ecological question** | **Recommended network type** | **Rationale** |
|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| What *could* have eaten what? (feasible interactions; trophic potential) | Feasibility web (PFIM, trait-based, evolutionary-signal models) | Captures all trait-feasible links; appropriate for reconstructing dietary breadth or assessing potential niches. |
| What interactions were *likely realised*? | Realised network (ADBM, l-matrix) | Encodes foraging ecology and energetic constraints; provides ecologically plausible 'realised' networks. |
| How do global macro structural properties vary? | Structural network (niche, random as baseline) | Useful for understanding generic patterns (connectance, trophic depth) without trait reliance. |
| How do traits influence dynamics (e.g., cascade sensitivity)? | Realised network | Capture body-size scaling, energetic constraints, and trophic dependencies. |
| How robust are inferences to uncertainty? | Ensembles across multiple network types | Allows quantifying how conclusions depend on assumptions. |

## Implications for paleoecological network studies

Our analysis underscores three important implications for the broader field:

1.  **Interpretations of ancient food webs must explicitly acknowledge model assumptions:** Without this, differences in reconstructed networks may be mistakenly attributed to biological change rather than methodological artifacts.

2.  **Comparisons across studies must be standardised by model family:** Comparing a metaweb from one study to a realised network from another risks generating misleading conclusions about ecological differences across space or time.

3.  **Integrating theory-driven models expands inference:** Mechanistic paleo-specific models alone capture only a subset of feasible networks. Incorporating modern theory-based approaches allows researchers to explore alternative network archetypes, extending the range of questions that can be addressed [@dunne2014; @solé2001].

## Recommendations for network reconstruction in paleoecology

To support consistent, transparent use of network reconstruction methods in paleoecology, we propose the following guidelines :

1.  **Start with the ecological question:** then identify the network representation (feasible, realised, structural) best aligned with it.

2.  **Use multiple models whenever possible:** to evaluate whether key conclusions are model-dependent.

3.  **Report all model assumptions explicitly and transparently:** including body-size estimation methods, trait inference procedures, and parameter choices.

4.  **Perform sensitivity analyses:** particularly for size-based models and connectance assumptions.

5.  **Avoid comparing networks built with different model families:** unless explicitly testing model effects.

6.  **Distinguish between node-level and link-level inference:** as they respond differently to model choice.

# Conclusions

Our study demonstrates that network reconstruction model choice is not a mere methodological detail; it fundamentally shapes the ecological narratives derived from fossil food webs. While broad patterns of species loss may appear robust across models, the identity of lost interactions, secondary extinctions, and inferred collapse pathways are highly sensitive to model assumptions, echoing findings from both modern and deep-time food-web research [@dunne2002; @allesina2012; @roopnarine2017; @dunhill2024]. By aligning network type with ecological questions, reporting assumptions transparently, and evaluating multiple models, paleoecologists can quantify uncertainty and extract more nuanced insights into community structure and dynamics. Integrating these practices bridges the gap between fossil evidence and ecological inference, enabling robust reconstructions of ancient ecosystems and more reliable comparisons across temporal and spatial scales.
