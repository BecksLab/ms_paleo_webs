abstract: |
  Food webs provide a powerful lens for understanding ecosystem structure and function, but reconstructing them in paleoecological contexts remains challenging because direct evidence of feeding interactions is rarely preserved. A wide range of models now exist for predicting interactions and inferring network structure, yet these models vary widely in their assumptions, mechanisms, and data requirements. Here, we evaluate which network construction approaches are most suitable for paleo-food-web reconstruction given the constraints of the fossil record, and we assess how model choice shapes the networks we infer. Using the Toarcian Oceanic Anoxic Event (Early Jurassic, ~183 Ma) as a case study, we compare six modelling approaches encompassing mechanistic, structural, and theory-based methods. These models yield strikingly different network structures and pairwise interactions, and that these discrepancies propagate into ecological inference, including conclusions about extinction dynamics. Our results highlight the importance of the need to align model choice with research questions and underscore the interpretative risks of treating all food-web reconstruction methods as interchangeable.

# Introduction

There is growing interest in using deep-time fossil data and evidence of species interactions in past ecosystems (*e.g.,* @dunne2008; @dunne2014) as a foundation for understanding how ecological communities respond to multi-stressor environmental change such as temperature increase, acidification and hypoxia in the oceans [@kiessling2019; @dillon2022]. In modern ecosystems, species interactions and the networks that they form are central to studying biodiversity, energy flow, and community stability (*e.g.,* @thuiller2024). Paleo networks represent a particularly valuable opportunity for understanding community response to major environmental transitions as we are able construct both the pre and post extinction network and tease apart the processes that drive extinctions as well as the broader ecological consequences of extinctions [@dunhill2024; @yeakel2014; @roopnarine2006]. SOmething about how what we learn here from the past will allow us to apply it to the current.

Making inference from a network, about its structure and complexity is a 'mathematical task' and thus relatively free of assumption. There are clear links to ecological theory and thus assumptions made when network structure and complexity is used to make inference about function and or as a template for simulating community dynamics and extension to extinction dynamics. Closing out with although we know what to 'do' with a network in terms of what can be inferred from structure/complexity and the bigger challenge is how we build the network since paleoecological data on interactions can never be directly observed, with rare exceptions (*e.g.,* @jenny2019; @vullo2011). As a result, the reconstruction of paleo food webs depends on inferring feeding relationships from preserved traits, analogies to modern taxa, and ecological theory.

While numerous tools exist for inferring species interactions (see @morales-castilla2015; @pichler2023; @strydom2021; @allesina2008 for broader reviews), only a subset can reliably be applied in paleo contexts, where data on traits, abundances, and community composition are inherently incomplete and biased and we need a clear discussion of which reconstruction approaches are suitable for which purposes. It is now established that reconstruction approaches (*e.g.,* models of species interactions based on traits, abundances and community composition) can be categorised by the type of network they predict (Strydom in prep). These types of networks have been labelled feasible (derived from trait matching and phylogenetic inference leading to metawebs of plausible species interactions), realised (derived from ecological rules and evidence of actual feeding interactions), or purely structural (networks that have an ecologically plausible structure but lack species identity at the node level). 

These different approaches to reconstruction each carry numerous assumptions that lead to variation in network size, complexity, structure and even node (species) level characteristics that impact on ecological interpretations about extinction dynamics, stability/resilience and ecosystem function. However, when it comes to the reconstruction of paleo webs most studies default to constructing networks using expert knowledge [*e.g.,* @dunne2008] or some sort of mechanistic feeding rules [*e.g.,* @dunhill2024; @roopnarine2017; @fricke2022] which results in the construction of a metaweb. This raises the question of how the type of network (especially those that are not metawebs) that is constructed controls not only the structure of the food web but also potentially alters the inferences that are made regarding the behaviour of the system - specifically the impact of extinctions [@roopnarine2006]

In this study, we link recent work on reconstruction methods to a comparative re-evaluation of primary and secondary, trait based extinction dynamics during the Toarcian hyperthemal climate change event [@dunhill2024]. We first reconstruct four networks using six reconstruction methods from defined periods in the Toarcian hyperthermal event: pre-extinction, post-extinction, early recovery and late recovery.  Using these communities, we compare the network and node (species) level characteristics predicted for each community by each of the size reconstruction methods.  This delivers inference on how the various methods and their ecological characterisations influence insight into the structure of paleoecological communities and estimated pairwise interactions. We then replicate the secondary extinction analysis in Dunhill et al focusing on the pre- to post-extinction transition, but with the six reconstruction methods. This specifically addresses how the assumptions associated with reconstruction methods, and the structural properties these dictate in networks, impact inference about the drivers and targets of paleo-hyperthermal mutli-stressor events.

# Methods

## Network construction approaches

Most existing paleo-specific approaches fall within the feasibility space (e.g., @shaw2024; @roopnarine2006; @fricke2022). While these are well-suited for reconstructing feasible interactions, they represent only a subset of the broader space of network construction methods. Here we include a selection methods that allow researchers to construct realised networks and address a wider suite of ecological questions - provided their assumptions are compatible with the limitations of fossil data. Here we present a range of models [@tbl-models] that carry specific assumptions and data requirements. For instance, certain tools depend on quantitative body-size estimates, which must be inferred from size classes or functional morphology in the fossil record. Structural models such as the niche model require only richness and connectance, but their species-agnostic nature limits their usefulness for trait-based or diet-specific questions. Approaches using mechanistic approaches rely on accurate assignment of feeding traits or strong support for phylogenetic relationships. Understanding how these limitations intersect with what fossil data can reliably provide is essential for selecting an appropriate modelling approach.

We evaluated six models spanning this space [@tbl-models]: random and niche models (structural network); allometric diet breadth (ADBM), l-matrix, and body-size ratio models (realised network); and a paleo food-web inference model (PFIM; feasibility web). These models differ in their assumptions, data requirements, and the types of networks they produce.

| Model family | Assumptions | Data needs | 'Limitation' | Network type | Key reference |
|------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|
| random | Links are randomly distributed within a network | richness, number of links | parameter assumptions, species agnostic | structural network | @erdos1959 |
| niche | Networks are interval, species can be ordered on a 'niche axis' | richness, connectance | parameter assumptions, species agnostic | structural network | @williams2008 |
| allometric diet breadth model (ADBM) | Interactions are determined by energetic costs (foraging ecology) | body mass, biomass (abundance) | does not account for forbidden links in terms of trait compatibility, assumptions on body size and biomass (abundance) from fossil data | realised network | @petchey2008 |
| l-matrix | Interactions inferred using allometric rules (ratio of body sizes between predator and prey), with links being constrained by a Ricker function | body mass, number of producer species | does not account for forbidden links in terms of trait compatibility, assumptions on body size from fossil data, assumptions as to the number of producer species | realised network | @schneider2016 |
| paleo food web inference model (PFIM) | Interactions can be inferred by a mechanistic framework/relationships | feeding traits for taxa, mechanistic feeding rules | Assumption made as to the feeding mechanisms, need to elucidate traits from models (although this is a way smaller issue) | feasibility web | @shaw2024 |

: Six different models that can be used to construct food webs for both this specific community but are also broadly suited to paleo network prediction. These models span all facets of the network representation space (metaweb, realised, and structural network) and are suitable for an array of different paleo communities as the data requirements fall within the limitations set by the fossil record. {#tbl-models}

## Case study: Toarcian Hyperthemal Event

### Fossil occurrence data

We used fossil occurrence data from the Cleveland Basin spanning the upper Pliensbachian to the upper Toarcian, following Dunhill et al. (2024). Four paleo-communities were defined: pre-extinction, post-extinction, early recovery, and late recovery. Each assemblage was treated as a community of potentially interacting taxa. Modes of life were assigned following Dunhill et al. (2024) using the Bambach ecospace framework. Traits included motility, tiering, feeding mode, and size class, with size defined categorically based on maximum linear dimensions.

### Network reconstruction and replication

For each community, we constructed 100 replicate networks using each of the six models (2 400 networks total). Networks were simplified by removing disconnected species. For size-based models, body masses were drawn from uniform distributions bounded by size-class limits, propagating uncertainty while preserving relative sizes within replicates. Structural models were parameterised using connectance values drawn from an empirically realistic ranges (0.07–0.34) while holding richness constant. The same parameter draws were used across comparable models within each replicate.

## Network metrics and statistical analyses

We quantified network structure using a suite of macro-, meso-, and micro-scale metrics [@tbl-properties], capturing global properties, motif structure, and species-level variability. Differences among models were assessed using MANOVA, followed by univariate ANOVAs, post-hoc comparisons, and linear discriminant analysis. Pairwise interaction turnover was quantified using link-based beta diversity for models that infer species-specific interactions.

| Metric | Definition | Scale | Reference (for maths), can make footnotes probs |
|------------------|-------------------|------------------|------------------|
| Richness | Number of nodes in the network | Macro |  |
| Links | Normalized standard deviation of links (number of consumers plus resources per taxon) | Micro |  |
| Connectance | $L/S^2$, where $S$ is the number of species and $L$ the number of links | Macro |  |
| Max trophic level | Prey-weighted trophic level averaged across taxa | Macro | @williams2004 |
| Diameter | Diameter can also be measured as the average of the distances between each pair of nodes in the network | Macro | @delmas2018 |
| Complexity | SVD complexity of a network, defined as the Pielou entropy of its singular values | Macro | @strydom2021 |
| Redundancy | $(L - (S - 1))/S$, where $S$ is the number of species and $L$ the number of links. Indicates the number of edges beyond what is needed for a minimum-connected tree | Macro |  |

| Vulnerability | Normalized standard deviation of vulnerability of a species standardized by $L/S$ | Micro | @williams2000 |

## Extinction simulations

Using pre-extinction networks, we simulated species loss under multiple extinction scenarios, including trait-based, network-position-based, and random removals, allowing for secondary extinctions. Simulated networks were compared to empirical post-extinction communities using mean absolute differences (MAD) in network metrics and a modified true skill statistic (TSS) at both node and link levels. Scenario rankings were compared across models using Kendall’s rank correlation coefficient.

# Results

## Model choice drives network structure

Despite identical taxon pools, different models produced networks with markedly different structural signatures. MANOVA revealed a strong multivariate effect of model type on network structure (Pillai’s Trace = 3.89, p \< 0.001), with model identity explaining most variation across metrics. Effect sizes were large for nearly all metrics, typically exceeding 0.80. The only exception was maximum trophic level (η² = 0.19), suggesting some convergence in vertical structure even when structure differs widely.

Three broad clusters emerged. PFIM produced the most connected and dense networks. ADBM and l-matrix networks formed a tight cluster characterised by constrained feeding ranges. Niche, random, and body-size ratio models occupied intermediate positions, with the body-size ratio model aligning more closely with structural models than with other theory-driven approaches. Linear discriminant analysis confirmed that model families occupy distinct regions of network space [@fig-structure].

## Divergence in pairwise interactions

Models also differed strongly in the specific interactions they inferred. Pairwise interaction turnover revealed that some models shared few inferred links despite similar global properties [@fig-beta_div]. ADBM and l-matrix showed high similarity, whereas the body-size ratio model exhibited consistently high turnover relative to others. PFIM shared intermediate levels of interaction overlap with size-based theoretical models. These results show that agreement in global metrics does not imply agreement in species-level diets or trophic roles.

## Model-dependent extinction dynamics

At a coarse level, different models often recovered similar rankings of extinction mechanisms, particularly for trait-driven scenarios. Kendall’s τ values based on MAD were generally positive, indicating partial agreement among models (panel XX @fig-mad). Node-level TSS scores were also broadly consistent across models, reflecting the fact that many extinction scenarios remove taxa in the same order (panel XX @fig-mad). In contrast, link-level outcomes differed substantially. Deterministic models such as PFIM produced consistent link-level matches, whereas stochastic theory-driven models generated variable cascade dynamics and lower agreement (panel XX @fig-mad). As a result, inferred pathways of collapse, trophic bottlenecks, and secondary extinctions depended strongly on model choice.

Panels illustrate how consistently different modelling approaches evaluate the relative realism of extinction scenarios across multiple network properties.](figures/kendal_tau.png){#fig-mad}

# Discussion

# Model Choice as an Ecological Inference Decision

Reconstructing food webs from fossil data is an exercise in inference under uncertainty, and our results demonstrate that the choice of network construction model is itself a major ecological inference decision. Despite using the same taxon pools, different models produced networks with profoundly different structural properties, interaction patterns, and inferred extinction dynamics. These differences emerge not from the fossil data themselves but from the assumptions embedded within each modelling approach. As a consequence, network reconstruction cannot be treated as a neutral methodological step: model choice fundamentally shapes the ecological narratives we extract from the fossil record. Across every structural metric we measured, model identity explained the majority of variation. PFIM-produced networks were consistently the most connected, while the ADBM and l-matrix produced sparser networks with tighter energetic constraints. Structural models (niche and random) fell between these extremes. These clusters reflect the conceptual differences between feasible, realised, and structural network representations. Importantly, these differences were not superficial. Pairwise interaction turnover revealed that models often disagreed not just on the number of links but on who interacts with whom. Such discrepancies directly affect diet-based ecological questions and interpretations of trophic roles.

## Consequences for interpreting paleoecological dynamics

The downstream effects of model choice were most evident when evaluating extinction dynamics. Models often recovered comparable high-level patterns (e.g., trait-driven extinction signals remained robust across models), but the specific ranking of extinction mechanisms varied. Node-level patterns were relatively stable because extinction scenarios based on intrinsic traits remove species in the same order regardless of network structure. However, link-level outcomes—particularly those concerning secondary extinctions, network collapse, and recovery trajectories—were highly model-dependent.

This means that conclusions about *how* an extinction unfolded, *which* interactions disappeared first, or *what* drove cascading losses are not simply properties of the fossil data but emerge from the assumptions embedded in the chosen model. Researchers therefore need to be explicit about the type of ecological signal they are trying to recover and select models accordingly.

## Aligning ecological questions with model choice

Our findings support a simple but crucial principle: different ecological questions require different types of network representations. The assumption that all food-web models are interchangeable is not supported by our results.

Below is a conceptual summary:

| **Ecological question** | **Recommended network type** | **Rationale** |
|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| What *could* have eaten what? (feasible interactions; trophic potential) | Feasibility web (PFIM, trait-based, evolutionary-signal models) | Captures all trait-feasible links; appropriate for reconstructing dietary breadth or assessing potential niches. |
| What interactions were *likely realised*? | Realised network (ADBM, l-matrix) | Encodes foraging ecology and energetic constraints; provides ecologically plausible 'realised' networks. |
| How do global macro structural properties vary? | Structural network (niche, random as baseline) | Useful for understanding generic patterns (connectance, trophic depth) without trait reliance. |
| How do traits influence dynamics (e.g., cascade sensitivity)? | Realised network | Capture body-size scaling, energetic constraints, and trophic dependencies. |
| How robust are inferences to uncertainty? | Ensembles across multiple network types | Allows quantifying how conclusions depend on assumptions. |

## Implications for the use of food webs in paleoecology

Our analysis underscores three important implications for the broader field:

1.  **Interpretations of ancient food webs must explicitly acknowledge model assumptions:** Without this, differences in reconstructed networks may be mistakenly attributed to biological change rather than methodological artifacts.

2.  **Comparisons across studies must be standardised by model family:** Comparing a metaweb from one study to a realised network from another risks generating misleading conclusions about ecological differences across space or time.

3.  **Mechanistic paleo-specific models alone cannot capture the full spectrum of possible network archetypes:** Incorporating theory-driven models allows paleoecology to leverage decades of research on modern food-web structure and dynamics, broadening the range of ecological questions that can be asked.

## Recommendations and best practices

To support consistent, transparent use of network reconstruction methods in paleoecology, we propose the following guidelines (which could be highlighted as a boxed summary):

1.  **Start with the ecological question:** then identify the network representation (feasible, realised, structural) best aligned with it.

2.  **Use multiple models whenever possible:** to evaluate whether key conclusions are model-dependent.

3.  **Report all model assumptions explicitly and transparently:** including body-size estimation methods, trait inference procedures, and parameter choices.

4.  **Perform sensitivity analyses:** particularly for size-based models and connectance assumptions.

5.  **Avoid comparing networks built with different model families:** unless explicitly testing model effects.

6.  **Distinguish between node-level and link-level inference:** as they respond differently to model choice.

# Conclusion

Our results reveal that network construction models differ far more than is commonly appreciated in paleoecology. Because food webs are increasingly used to infer ecological resilience, collapse dynamics, and responses to environmental change, it is crucial to recognise that these inferences are shaped as much by modelling decisions as by fossil data. By mapping model families to ecological questions and demonstrating how model assumptions influence inferred patterns, our study provides a framework for more transparent, robust, and question-driven reconstruction of paleo food webs.
